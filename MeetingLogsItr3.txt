A short meeting was had to discuss work distribution. Tasks were written down as a combination of feedback from the TA, feedback from the QA team, previous big stories that were put down for itr3 and previous pending issues. Work was allocated based on individuals previous work and experience with considerations for flexibility.

The email opt-in big user story previously advertised was deemed to be changed to simply be an in-app notification since we believe that looking into and implementating email notifications to be too big a task for this iteration. Similarly, while we had working images in the product catalogue for iteration 1, we will be removing them from itr 3 to give more time to ensuring we can complete a stable program.

The task distribution decided is as follows:

Stubbed version of database																	- Andre
WishlistPage class needs to simplified														- Neha
Comments on all classes																		- Andre
Inheritance needs to be used																- Andre
Separate everything into different packages (refactor of directories)						- Gabriel R
WRITE TESTS																					- Everyone
	This means separate backend logic from UI classes and write test cases for them
Implement product notifications (missing from client team)									- Bhargav
Need more meeting logs																		- Gabriel R
Missing Libraries 																			- Gabriel R
Fix previous issues ?
Rework database																				- Gabriel R

Issue #15																					- Gabriel R
Issue #16 Extra Code																		- Neha
	getTotal calls getSubTotal and adds tax on top
Issue #17																					- Andre
Issue #18 More test cases, this is on everyone												- Everyone
Issue #19 Update UML class diagram															- Bhargav

Product Reviews																				- Neha
Order History																				- Gabriel K
Product notifications																		- Bhargav
Job Availability																			- Gabriel K

Finish up WishlistPage																		- Neha
Login should persistent																		- Andre
DB should not be accessed constantly														- Gabriel R

A Meeting was had to work on the Presentation as a team and discuss how we will present as well as revising our progress with the iteration 3 plan.

All members shared the work they had done and revised what can be done by Friday. Below is the updated list with light work reallocation and status. A large portion of the test cases were written however still need to be cleaned up, particularly where code refactors affected method calls. Overall, work is on track and most of the remaining work lies in merging the varying branches.
