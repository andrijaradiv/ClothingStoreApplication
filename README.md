# Clothing4You App
Clothing4You is an application made to do shopping for our valued customers. It is a clothing app that will be easy to use and simple to buy clothing products for everyday life. It will display the latest fashion so that customers can follow the trend.

The customer should be able to register in our app through a few simple steps. Next, they should be able to look through all the products which are displayed. Users should be able to scroll and look at some beautiful styles and proceed to buying options. Our app will be efficient to do the checkout process for the registered customers as it provides delivery and nearby pickup options.

To run the application, run App.java file or execute the .jar.

On application being opened, if they do not already exist, the database local file is created, the tables for users and product catalog are created and lightly prepopulated with basic data. This is done so that there will always be at least one account with which the client can log in with and so that the product catalog has some default items. Currently, no further items can be added to product catalog however in the next iteration, admin accounts will be able to add products through the UI to the database which the product catalog loads from.

We do not have a dependency injection as we did not have an original "stub" to work off of.
